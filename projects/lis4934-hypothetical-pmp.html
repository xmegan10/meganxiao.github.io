								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>I have been tasked by the University of South Florida’s Chief Information Officer to create a database system for standardizing software tracking across all departments. Not only will USF’s IT Department use the database to input software records daily, but they will also maintain and manage the database along with the website GUI. The stakeholders, the Chief Information Officer and the IT Department, provided my team and me with a budget of $80,000 for this project. They require completion within six months of initiation.</p>
                                
								<h2>Initiation Phase</h2>
								<p>The individuals necessary to complete the database include the Senior Database Architect, the Lead Web Developer, and their respective cohorts. I will assign these roles to the individuals in my current team. Weekly meetings will be hosted to (1) specify each team member’s role within the scope of this project and (2) outline the needs and limitations of the project set by the stakeholders.</p>
								<p>Before university-wide deployment, the stakeholders will review, run, and test the database, which has been agreed upon by them and the IT Department to be called the “Academic Software Tracker” (ATS). General needs of this project include (1) a report with the timed difference between the current software tracking system, a spreadsheet, and the ATS, and (2) the estimated ROI of the ATS compared to the current software tracking system. Limitations include (1) compliance with the current software environment standards and (2) compliance with USF branding during the creation of the website GUI.</p>
								<p>These meetings will run over the course of a month until a clear understanding of roles, needs, and limitations has been established and documented. Documentation will be stored in the “ATS SharePoint” for others to use as a point of reference throughout the project.</p>

								<h2>Definition Phase</h2>
								<p>These meetings will run over the course of a month until a clear understanding of roles, needs, and limitations has been established and documented. Documentation will be stored in the “ATS SharePoint” for others to use as a point of reference throughout the project.</p>
								<p>During this phase, I will define the functional and operational requirements, design limitations, and final testers for pre-deployment. Functionally, the ATS must retrieve and store new software records within a minute of user queries. Operationally, the ATS will be accessed through a front-end web-based GUI. The database developers will build the ATS within existing Oracle database environments, while the web developers will build the GUI using Python Django. These guidelines serve as the definitive requirements established for approval and will be added as documentation in the ATS SharePoint.</p>
								<p>Before university-wide deployment, I will sample individuals from the IT Department to test the software. Tests will include querying 100 pre-existing software records into the ATS and recording the accuracy rate and query time. These records will be added as a CSV file in the ATS SharePoint.</p>

								<h2>Design Phase</h2>
								<p>Once proper documentation of the goals and restrictions has been established, the design phase will proceed. The database developer team will create entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to visualize relationships between software variables, and UML schemas to visualize the flow of communication between the front- and back-end. Web developers will create wireframe prototypes for web-based GUI. </p>
								<p>Database developers will propose and share ERDs and UML diagrams with the Senior Database Architect, who will oversee them. This will take place during weekly meetings until a final ERD and UML schema have been decided on. The same process will occur for the web developer team. During the development of the UML schema, database and web developers will discuss and outline the interaction between the web-based GUI and the ATS back-end.</p>
								<p>Once final designs have been decided, designs will be stored in the ATS SharePoint to serve as a reference for developers in the next phase.</p>

								<h2>Development Phase</h2>
								<p>Before development, I will gather the suppliers, contractors, materials, and tools needed for the project. To comply with the existing software environment, AWS will be used to host the server, Oracle will be used as our Database Management System (DBMS) vendor, and specialized education-focused suppliers, like <i>AppsAnywhere</i>, will help track software licenses. Cybersecurity Auditors will be hired at the end of the phase to ensure the database is secure and complies with legal requirements. Materials and tools used for the development of the back end include Oracle DB and dB Visualizer. Python and Django will be used for the front-end. </p>
								<p>The development team will build the database in two-week “sprints” following the Agile methodology. Tasks will be managed through Jira. Lead developers will review code and maintain version control throughout. During bi-weekly meetings, lead developers will report to me with their progress and blockers. </p>

								<h2>Implementation Phase</h2>
								<p>Once the ATS has achieved a level of stability and performance, and all tasks have been completed in Jira, testing will begin to transfer existing records from the spreadsheet to the ATS. Testing ends when (1) 99% accuracy rate is achieved between the spreadsheet and ATS records, and (2) queries run under a minute. The results will be delivered to the Chief Information Officer.</p>
								<p>Once the CIO approves the test results, the team will run another test where the sample of IT individuals will input new records from an institutional department within USF (e.g., the School of Education) into the ATS. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 99% for non-erroneous records and queries, completed in under a minute, is required to proceed. Once these requirements are met, the tracker will be released to the entire IT Department.</p>

								<h2>Follow-up Phase</h2>
								<p>I, along with the Senior Database Architect and Lead Web Developer, will produce a digital SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for the IT Department and conduct training sessions regarding proper ATS maintenance protocols. The IT Department will create a new ticket category within the USF IT Portal for “ATS Support” for future technical support. Monthly reminders will be set up to alert the IT Department to regularly update security patches for the ATS. Six months post-launch, we will conduct a Post-Implementation Review to calculate the ROI in saved licensing fees, which we will deliver to the stakeholders.</p>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>This essay demonstrates the application of project management skills through the hypothetical development of a software-tracking database system. Using the Project Management Handbook (Baars, 2006), I have followed the six steps outlined and have applied it to this context, which included gathering the required individuals (Senior Database Architect, developer team, and web developers), outlining the needs and limitations for the scope of the project, overseeing the project in bi-weekly sprint meetings, running accuracy and timed tests as deliverables for the stakeholders (CIO and the IT Department), releasing the product in a university-wide rollout once satisfactory results have been achieved, and monitoring and maintaining post-release.</p>
								<p>This project has taught me to consider all individuals involved and their overall business needs, as this dictates the entire scope and direction of the project.</p>
