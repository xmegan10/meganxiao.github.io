								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Despite the abundance of data today, it remains underutilized. According to Khan (2025), 72% of businesses don't consider their data as a strategic asset; not because data is useless, but because they often lack the workforce to extract actionable insight. Worse, processing raw data and visualizing it involves multiple steps, and any error from beginning to end can mean the difference between success and failure for a business. In this essay, I analyze two TED Talk speakers who discuss how data scientists can collect raw data, clean, organize, visualize, and apply human insights to deliver practical value.
</p>
                                
								<h2>TED Talk 1</h2>
								<p>In the first video, "The human insights missing from big data," Tricia Wang, a "tech ethnographer" and advisor to C-suite leaders in the fields of tech, data, and customer growth, discusses the risk of "quantification bias", wherein individuals over-rely on numeric data without considering human experiences. She argues that data scientists should focus more on "thick data," that is, unquantifiable insights from humans, and combine it with big data (TED, 2017). In her first job as a researcher at Nokia, she worked with poor communities in China. At the time, smartphones had just been released, and, although these devices failed to impress individuals in the United States, she learned that, with great surprise, the poor were willing to spend almost half of their monthly savings on them; however, when she presented this insight to Nokia, they dismissed her, claiming her sample size was too small and that none of their big data points indicated anyone wanting to buy a smartphone. Years later, their business crashed. On the other hand, companies like Netflix, which had devised a recommendation algorithm around binge-watching, properly integrated thick data with big data, creating success for themselves.
</p>
								<p>Although Tricia does not fully explain the process of collecting unbiased and relevant qualitative data and applying it to existing quantitative data, which would have been practical, her perspective offers a new angle on data-gathering: having the proper domain expertise to avoid producing biased or irrelevant results. As an aspiring data scientist, I will undoubtedly need to make precise decisions when gathering, processing, and organizing data, and the method I choose for each business problem will differ based on the end goal. If I don’t understand and glean practical information from the field of study, I could produce erroneous models and algorithms.</p>

								<h2>TED Talk 2</h2>
								<p>In the second video, "The beauty of data visualization," David McCandless, a writer, designer, and creative director with a focus on data visualization, presents a series of visualizations like line graphs, bar charts, and tree maps. For each visualization, he invites the audience to guess the labels and titles before revealing them (TED, 2012). At first, the trends seem random and confusing; in one of the examples, visualizing a timeline of global media panic, twin peaks of mass panic regarding violent video games occur every November and April; while November makes intuitive sense in that people give and receive video games as gifts for the holidays and a select few may have concerns over the contents of such games, April seems unusual. But David goes on to explain its significance: the 1999 Columbine shooting took place in April, and when the month came around, panic welled in response to violent video games. Another important facet of data visualization is the importance of relativity. In an example comparing the military sizes of countries, David shows military size ranking, first, by budget, then GDP, then absolute size, and then per 100,000 people; for each category, no country ranks first for all visualizations because each one is compared in absolute numbers. When creating a visualization, it's crucial to set a relative baseline appropriate for the situation to avoid misinformation and bias.
</p>
								<p>David excels in explaining different methods of visualizing data and the impact different types of visualization have on the audience. Styles of visualization include using size, color, and space to highlight the importance of particular attributes. Different research problems call for different styles of visualizations. Although the topics are surface knowledge, it succeeds as a brief introduction to accurate data visualization. Not only do analysts need to clean and organize data, but they also need to find a way to deliver it to nonspecialists. As a data scientist, choosing how I visualize a particular problem will impact possible business insights; if I don't present an appropriate picture, such as dismissing relevant values or cutting out crucial data points, it can skew the truth. Like processing and gathering data, bad data visualization can tilt a business to failure.</p>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>Both videos discuss two crucial steps: data gathering and data visualization. The first video delves more into the human aspect as a part of the data gathering process, while the second video explores the importance of delivering data visualizations in a user-friendly way. As I hope to get a job in marketing or healthcare, presenting accurate and understandable information is vital.</p>
