								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>My name is Megan Xiao. I'm an undergraduate student from the University of South Florida pursuing a degree in Information Science, Data Science & Analytics. I live in and was born in Sarasota, Florida, a small suburban city just an hour south of USF's main campus, Tampa; however, my parents emigrated from China, making me a second-generation Chinese American. Although I spend much of my time fine-tuning my data science skills, my hobbies include exercise, drawing, writing stories, and composing music. Many people think of art and data as a contradictory combination, but I would argue they complement each other; during my educational journey, I've learned that data science doesn't rely solely on raw, pure math, but on a variety of skills, such as the ability to portray user-friendly visualizations and translate business requirements into technical instructions.</p>
                                
								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<p>Throughout my courses, I've gained a vast amount of experience in R, an object-oriented programming language for statisticians, and R Studio, a popular integrated development environment designed for R. On the theoretical side, I've learned how to identify messy data frames and clean them with packages, such as R's tidyverse and dplyr. I've learned how to illustrate insights with ggplot2 and provide predictions via various machine learning algorithms. On the side, I've used Python, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and SQL, applying similar concepts from R on personal projects and challenges. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, which helped me create my portfolio website. Ultimately, I aspire to get at least one Cloud/DevOps certificate, such as DP-100, Microsoft's Azure Data Scientist certification, to further my understanding of the upstream and downstream data pipelines.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of professional experience, I'm currently a Business Analyst at Four Winds IT Consulting, where I analyze our clients' behaviors to create campaigns and emails that attract potential leads. During the summer of 2025, I remodelled the intake and approval process of new solution architecture requests using Power Automate and Power Apps as an Enterprise & Business Architect intern at FCCI, reducing the manual need to review requests one by one via email. As an extension of my studies, I currently volunteer as a USF lab student of Dr. Hagen's Big Data Analytics lab, where I help clean large data sets and visualize them using R. Previously, I've worked as a Crew Member at my local Dunkin', which helped me gain valuable customer experience and POS management skills. I've volunteered at nonprofit organizations, such as Sarasota Humane Society, Big Cat Habitat, and the National Audubon Society.
</p>

<h2>Aspirations</h2>
<p>
    I aim to become a data scientist or analyst in either the marketing or healthcare industry—marketing, because I want to predict customer behavior, speech, and general patterns to generate revenue and maximize ROI growth, and healthcare, because I'd love the opportunity to predict diseases and help develop treatments. 
</p>
<p>
    Marketing requires an intersection of human psychology and data-driven insights to make accurate predictions. Valuable skills include attribution modeling, customer segmentation, and campaign analytics; technical skills require Python/R and SQL. Marketers and, by extension, businesspeople prefer visualizations and graphs, such as those in Power BI, because they translate unorganized data to straightforward insights; therefore, data scientists must possess excellent communication and storytelling abilities. Data scientists in marketing earn an average of $160,000 per year. 
</p>
<p>
    Healthcare, on the other hand, is more technical and algorithmic than marketing, and although it also requires knowledge of Python/R and SQL, data scientists in healthcare need to be able to build machine learning models, manipulate large, unstructured datasets, and understand medical terminology. Data scientists must also comply with data regulations, such as HIPAA, to maintain confidentiality and ensure data security. Data scientists in healthcare earn an average of $150,000 per year.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Out of all the skills listed above, I aspire to improve my communication, model-building, and math skills. Although knowing how tools work is useful, understanding the math behind algorithms and being able to communicate that math to non-scientific individuals takes longer to learn and is much more practical in the business and academic world.
